To conclude the simple and minimalistic design does restrict the user for unwanted addictive social media websites but , for using feature like dark theme should be free. Moreover instead of allowing any two custom applications addictive applications such as “Facebook, WhatsApp ,Instagram” or games like “pubg, clash of clans” etc.  can be blocked. Also If these applications can be blocked for particular time interval then it will be a great plus.

The application has a simple user interface but fails to give a feedback after any user action has been performed.

The system allows only two applications that can be customized. Moreover, if the user wants to change a set custom map , the only way to do so is to go to settings and reset , instead of modifying the previously set application.
The application boasts a simple user Interface and can be used by an novice user. All the user operated functions are single step processes. Once the home screen is set with desired existing applications the user needs to just click one of them.

The system does provide error messages in plain language but provided but at times are irrelevant.
