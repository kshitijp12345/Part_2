Another challenge could be finding an available court near you, playing fun and competitive tournaments. Moreover some may prefer learning new game or taking coaching lessons. All the above said constraints are taken care by Rovo.

Once the application is downloaded , the system asks to build up your profile by asking some basic questions about your knowledge about the game you chose . These questions help you understand your strength and weaknesses and areas of improvements. Once you are done with your profile Rovo will suggest games nearby you. You could join those games or could invite someone of the level as you are to join you. 

Another feature Rovo boasts is you can keep a track of your games. Games can be tracked when required number of players for a game is set. Moreover you can earn badges from other playing members. Badges is recognition given by other players if they like your skill. Also after successfully completing a game you earn a rating point.

The system makes use of Artificial intelligence by suggesting existing groups for a particular game depending on the user’s activity. Also the system has a Chat-bot to post admin messages on users wall which again uses artificial intelligence. 

To sum up, the application does helps to improve your skill set by making a self-assessment and suggesting more games nearby. It also tracks your game and gives a constant feedback which in turn improves your game gradually. Moreover by providing badges and private group it also adds fun element but it also needs functionality to edit, delete a post. Also if I could auto detect location instead of manual setting it will add to better user experience.

## Less phone Launcher

Less phone Launcher is a mobile application that restricts its users from over-using their smartphone. The application is available on Google Play store with possibility of IOS version. The application restricts the user to click on 4 tabs. Out of the four tabs, one is for call and other one is for to-do task list. Therefore the user is restricted to select just two application from pre-installed applications of the phone. If you think you are addicted to social media websites , videos, music or any game available in the market then this the application which will limit the access to these websites. It will allow just three life oriented functions. 

Once the application is downloaded , there will be predefined tabs for phone and tasks. After clicking on the tasks tab, the user can add different to-do list items. The items get listed as the user adds more items. If a particular item is complete then it can be marked accordingly in the tasks section. Another feature of this application is that the user can set this launcher as default launcher , thus making is more difficult to use addictive apps. Moreover it allows to set two custom applications ensuring all the distractions are removed. It also provides access to phone settings to change other application settings.

The application boasts a simple user Interface and can be used by an novice user. All the user operated functions are single step processes. Moreover the application has an simple and minimalistic design. In case of aesthetics the user won’t find any fancy user interface. The application is designed from functional perspective rather than having a good user interface experience.

To conclude the simple and minimalistic design does restrict the user for unwanted addictive social media websites but , for using feature like dark theme should be free. Moreover instead of allowing any two custom applications addictive applications such as “Facebook, WhatsApp ,Instagram” or games like “pubg, clash of clans” etc.  can be blocked. Also If these applications can be blocked for particular time interval then it will be a great plus.
